Are you confused about how to create a folder with a list name or with a number sequence name? Just use the bulkfolder tool to create folders quickly.


## How To Run

for Linux users, how to find out the full path, use pwd, then paste the full path output.

```bash
pwd
```

Find the file or folder whose path you want to know in File Explorer. Hold Shift on your keyboard and right-click on it. In the context menu that appears, select "Copy As Path." or If you don't want to use the right-click menu, you have a few other options. You can also just click and select the file, then hit "Copy Path" on the toolbar at the top.
